// A LEAF: imports only zod and the user-settings namespace schemas.

/**

 *
 * WHY THIS IS A MODELLED BLOCK (#225). This gate is framework-level and
 * security-adjacent (an operator turning off a delivery channel for everyone,
 * or silencing one noisy event), so it gets a real type, a real default, and
 * somewhere for its semantics to live — not an untyped flag in an open map.
 *
 * WHAT ENFORCES IT (#226). Three consumers, all reading through
 * `notifications/notification-policy.ts`, which is the only place these two
 * fields are interpreted:
 *
 *   * `resolveChannels` — the dispatcher's gate. A `browser` channel this
 *     policy disallows is not delivered over.
 *   * `GET /api/notifications/events` — the same filter, so the preferences
 *     matrix cannot offer a channel the dispatcher would refuse.
 *   * the SSE payload's `toast` flag, and `GET /api/notifications/config`,
 *     which is how a non-admin client learns the capability is off without
 *     being granted `system_settings:read`.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SWITCH OFF: the `notifications` row itself for
 * a `mandatory` event. Muting a toast must not mute an audit-relevant inbox
 * entry — see notification-policy.ts, which carries the full argument.
 *
 * Web Push (#229/#230) will read the same block when it lands.
 *
 * `disabledEvents` holds `NOTIFICATION_EVENTS` keys and is validated with
 * `notificationEventKeySchema` — the same syntactic bound the per-user
 * preference keys use. A second, hand-rolled pattern here would be a second
 * place for the `<area>.<event>` convention to be wrong, and the wrong direction
 * is an event key an operator cannot suppress because the admin page 400s.
 * It is a syntactic bound, NOT a registry check: an entry naming an event this
 * build does not declare is stored and simply never matches, which is what keeps
 * a rollback across the addition of an event uneventful.

// Operations namespaces (epic #254, issue #256)
// =============================================================================
//
// Four blocks — the job queue, the worker fleet, database backup/restore and
// the maintenance window — declared here BEFORE the code that reads them
// exists. Every consumer arrives in a later issue of the epic; today nothing
// in this build looks at a single one of these values.
//
// WHY THEY ARE DECLARED AS ONE REGISTRY ENTRY EACH (#459). A namespace on this
// row used to have to be written down in SIX places that nothing linked
// together (the stored schema, its partial, the PUT and PATCH wire bodies,
// `SystemSettingsValue` + the defaults, and the service's merge), and missing
// the wire bodies made every real PATCH silently no-op: the request body is
// parsed by the wire DTO first, zod strips the key it does not know, and the
// service is handed a body with the caller's change already deleted (the same
// class of silent loss #130 fixed one layer down). Each namespace is now ONE
// declaration (`settings/registry/core-system-namespaces.ts`) built from the
// schemas below, registered in `kvox.manifest.ts`; the stored schema, both wire
// bodies, the response and the defaults are composed from the registry, and
// `common/schemas/settings-parity.spec.ts` iterates it.
//
// REQUIRED HERE, OPTIONAL ON THE WIRE — and that asymmetry is deliberate; see
// `updateSystemSettingsSchema` for the argument. In short: this schema
// describes the STORED value, which is always complete because
// `readKnownSettings` fills every block from `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_SETTINGS`; the
// PUT body is what an existing client sends, and no existing client knows
// these blocks exist yet.
//
// NO `.default()` ANYWHERE IN THIS SECTION, on purpose. A `.default()` here
// would make `systemSettingsSchema.parse()` mint values silently, which moves
// the defaults out of the declaration's `defaults` (where they are visible,
// documented and seeded) and into whichever parse happened to run first. Every
// default lives in `settings/registry/core-system-namespaces.ts` and nowhere
// else.

 * SECOND switch rather than a reuse of `nodes.jobSecretBrokerEnabled`, because
 * the two answer different questions and a deployment can genuinely want one

 *     machine that is not the API server what this deployment wants, given
 *     that the node needs a network route to PostgreSQL and the archive's
 *     bytes will cross whatever network sits between them?
 *
 * Collapsing them would mean enabling brokering for any future type — a
 * fork's own `nodeSecretBroker` — silently enables shipping the database
 * dump off-box too, which is not a decision anybody made. Both must be true,
 * AND the broker must report itself usable, before the type is offered to a
 * node; see `NodesService.nodeEligibleTypes`. Off (either one) means the type
 * is withheld from the claim and the in-process worker takes the backup, which
