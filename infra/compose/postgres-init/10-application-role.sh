# Creates the ORDINARY role the application connects as (issue #725 PP-6.5)
# =============================================================================
#
# Row-level security is inert for a superuser or a BYPASSRLS role: every policy,
# FORCE included, is skipped. The postgres image makes POSTGRES_USER a
# superuser, so these development and test databases keep that bootstrap login
# as `postgres` (administration only) and create the role the API runs as here:
#
#   NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS  so the tenant-isolation policies apply to it;
#   CREATEDB                 so restore can create, rename and drop databases;
#   CREATEROLE               so the node-offload broker can mint per-job roles
#                            (with createrole_self_grant set: PostgreSQL 16).
#
# It owns the application database, which makes it the owner of every table the
# migrations create (FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY is what applies the policies to an
# owner). Runs once, on the first start of an empty data volume (the image's
# /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d contract). Set APP_DB_USER to "postgres" to opt
# out; the Doctor then reports the role as a superuser and tenant isolation as
# not enforced. Existing volumes are not touched: see
# docs/SECURITY-ARCHITECTURE.md (Tenant isolation (RLS), "The application role").
